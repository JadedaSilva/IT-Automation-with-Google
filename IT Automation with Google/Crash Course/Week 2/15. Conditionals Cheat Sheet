Comparison operators

a == b: a is equal to b

a != b: a is different than b

a < b: a is smaller than b

a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b

a > b: a is bigger than b

a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b


Logical operators

a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.

a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.

not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.

Branching blocks

if condition1:
	if-block
elif condition2:
	elif-block
else:
	else-block

The if-block will be executed if condition1 is True. The elif-block will be executed
if condition1 is False and condition2 is True. The else block will be executed
when all the specified conditions are false.
